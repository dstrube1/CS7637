Question 1: Excellently written. Very clear and concise, with great use of figures and table to illustrate the process used to come to conclusions.

Question 2: Table 3 heading was on a different page than Table 3. Same for Table 5.

Below Table 5 there is another "Table 1"; I'm guessing that was supposed to be Table 6.

Otherwise, all very well written.
